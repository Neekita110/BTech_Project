# CO2 Absorption and Gibbs Free Energy Prediction App | B.Tech Project

## Overview
This Streamlit application predicts CO2 absorption rates and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) using machine learning models. It allows users to either manually input molecular descriptors or select a compound from a preloaded dataset. The app is designed with an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to perform predictions with accuracy. Models are trained on feature sets of 109 and 359 descriptors to ensure reliable predictions for CO2 absorption and ΔG.

## Features
- **Manual Input or Dataset Selection**: Users can manually enter molecular descriptors or choose a compound from a dataset for predictions.
- **CO2 Absorption and ΔG Prediction**: Models provide accurate predictions for both CO2 absorption rates and Gibbs free energy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit-based UI simplifies interaction and data input, suitable for both academic and research applications.

## Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Models trained on feature sets with 109 and 359 molecular descriptors
