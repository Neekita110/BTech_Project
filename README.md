This Streamlit app predicts CO2 absorption rates and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) using machine learning models. Users can either input molecular descriptors manually or choose a compound from a dataset. The app features an intuitive interface and models trained on 109 and 359 features for accurate predictions of CO2 absorption and ΔG.
